                        <p></p>You would expect that as technology progresses and quality of life improves, that so would our food, right? Wrong. We are headed in the wrong diraction as our food is
                        becoming incrasingly engineered providing benefits of profit to the manufacturer at the cost of our health. Food is being pumped with all kinds of chemicals that benefit the
                        producers such that food lasts longer on the shelves, looks more appealing to shoppers, and tastes better but all at the cost of the consumer potentially developing life
                        threatening dieseases and overall lowering our health quality. 
                        <p>Consequences of these substances include <b><em>diabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, neurological diseases, and many kinds of cancers</em></b>. There is a plethora of research that
                        provides evidence of these consequences, yet governments and organizations are lobbied and provided biased studies to keep these chemicals legal.</p>
                        <p>The wide array of harmful additives in our food feels it could utilize all the letters in the alphabet in all sorts of combinations, such like  BHA, BHT, TBHQ, PEAS, BVO, etc. ABCDEFG, you get the picture. </p>

                        <p>In considering of the insurmountable kinds of chemicals and modifications to our food, the seemingly endless list of of these needs to be tackled one at a time. For this
                        purpose, we will be concentrating on some of the most prevelant occuring and commonly consume additives on the market. It's iperative to recognize that artificial sweetners,
                        artificial colors, and nitrates/nitrites in our food that have been proven to cause devestation on the consumer's health should be avoided and even outlawed. </p>
